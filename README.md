# Marketing Campaign Brochures
Maximise profit for Simulation Corporation

Your Role:
You are a member of the Stat team of Sim Corp., a high-end retailer based out of San Fransisco, California. They have their apparel stores (four franchises) spread across Bay Area. ‘Classic Choice’ (CC) is the biggest of the 4 franchises. The other franchises are ‘Apparel Monarch’ (AM), ‘Apparel Xtra’ (AX) and ‘Popular Style’ (PS). The firm decided about a seasonal marketing campaign in 2015 Spring-Summer for the first time, and sent their brochure to 21,740 customers chosen randomly. The campaign cost was ~$30 per customer. 3,611 of the customers were observed to have responded where incremental revenue in the month after the mailers were sent was more than 10% as compared to similar period in the previous year. Average incremental revenue from responders was worth ~$170

Although the campaign didn’t generate net incremental revenue last year, it showed promise w.r.t. the incremental revenue generated from individual responders. Hence the management of Sim Corp. decided to run the campaign in 2016 as well. However this time they want to make a data driven strategy to target the customers effectively

Objective:
The objective is to use data for the customers who received the brochures from 2015 campaign and device a methodology to identify potential responders. Finally, use the framework to build a marketing strategy for the 2016 Spring-Summer campaign
